# Versioning

Stars! has two version numbers, and only one of them changes on `main`.

## Product version

The version of the executable, stored in its `VERSIONINFO` resource and
shown to players. `cmake/version.cmake` generates it from git into
`<build>/generated/version.h` on every build:

| Checkout | Version | Shown as | Build |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clean checkout of tag `v2.8.0` | `2.8.0` | `2.8x64` | 0 |
| Clean checkout of tag `v2.8.1` | `2.8.1` | `2.8.1x64` | 0 |
| 12 commits after `v2.8.0` | `2.8.1-dev.12+g1a2b3c4` | `2.8x64 (2.8.1-dev.12+g1a2b3c4)` | 12 |
| Same, with uncommitted changes | `2.8.1-dev.12+g1a2b3c4.dirty` | `2.8x64 (2.8.1-dev.12+g1a2b3c4.dirty)` | 12 |
| Before the first `v` tag | `2.8.0-dev.N+g…`, N counted from `2.6jrc3` | `2.8x64 (2.8.0-dev.N+g…)` | N |

The version (`STARS_VERSION_STRING`) is what tags, `FileVersion` and the
release check use; it never names a platform (a semver `-` suffix would
make it a pre-release). The name shown (`STARS_VERSION_DISPLAY`) adds the
platform: the Windows build keeps the `x64` players know, `2.8x64` for
2.8.0 and `2.8.1x64` for 2.8.1, and other builds of `stars-host` name
theirs after the version: `2.9 linux-x64`, `2.9 macos-x64`,
`2.9 macos-arm64`. CMake passes the platform (`STARS_VERSION_PLATFORM`,
`os-arch`) to `cmake/version.cmake`. Development builds append the full
version in parentheses. It appears in the About box, on the splash screen
and in report headers (`SzVersion` in `util.c`), in `ProductVersion`, in
release titles and in `stars-host --version`.

A development build is numbered toward the next version: the patch after the
last `vX.Y.Z` tag, or `project(stars VERSION …)` in `CMakeLists.txt` if that
is higher. To start a new minor version (2.9.0), raise the `project()`
version; patch releases need no version commit. `VERSIONINFO` carries
`MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH,BUILD`.

Source archives without git history build as `X.Y.Z-dev.0+gunknown`; set
`STARS_VERSION=2.8.0` in the environment to stamp them.

Patch releases of 2.8 are tagged on the `2.8` branch (`v2.8.1`), whose
builds count toward 2.8.1. `main` has `project()` at 2.9.0, so its builds
read `2.9.0-dev.N+g…`, counted from `v2.8.0`.

## Releasing

```sh
git tag v2.8.0
git push origin v2.8.0
```

The release workflow builds the tag, checks that it produced exactly
`2.8.0`, and publishes "Stars! 2.8x64" with `stars.exe` and `stars!.hlp`.
Every push to `main` updates the rolling `latest` prerelease, whose title
shows the name of the build. Other tags (such as `2.6jrc3` on the `2.6j`
branch) still publish releases named after the tag.

## File format version

Saves, turn files and race files carry their own version in `RTBOF`
(`verMajor`/`verMinor`/`verInc`). The original wrote 2.83 (`save.c`) and
refused files from 2.84 or later (`file.c`, `mdi.c`, `save.c`). 2.8 writes
2.84 and reads 2.49 through 2.84: it picks up games, turns and races from
2.6j/2.7, while 2.6j/2.7 refuse files written by 2.8 instead of playing on
with different rules. The records themselves are unchanged. It is not tied
to the product version; change it only together with a real file-format
change, and expect older versions to reject the files.
