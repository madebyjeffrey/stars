# Stars!

![meme](docs/images/windows10stars.jpg)

Stars! 4X game rebuilt from decompiled C sources using a custom [stars-asm](https://github.com/sirgwain/stars-asm/tree/main) win16 disassembler the decompiler.

The original 2.6jrc3 stars.exe included ~1MB of debug symbols with function names, variable names, symbol definitions, and even line numbers. The stars-asm project used that information to rebuild the Stars! source to be as close to the original as possible.

## Branches

- `2.6j` (tag `2.6jrc3`): the faithful reconstruction, original bugs
  included. It matches the original game turn for turn in the fixed-seed
  regression.
- `2.8` (tag `v2.8.0`): the released 2.8 line, bug fixes only. It fixes
  original bugs and replaces the Win16 shims with native code. It reads
  2.6j files and writes the same formats, marked as version 2.84 so that
  2.6j doesn't load them.
- `main`: the 2.9 line, splitting the game into core, UI and host builds so
  the host can run on Linux.

## Documentation

- [Reconstruction](docs/RECONSTRUCTION.md): how the source was rebuilt from the
  decompiler's output, and the conventions it follows.
- [Native port](docs/NATIVE-PORT.md) and [Win16 parity](docs/WIN16-PARITY.md):
  what the Win32/Win64 build changes, and the original behavior it reproduces.
- [Known bugs](docs/KNOWN-BUGS.md): the original release bug list, mapped to
  source.
- [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md): the work planned for 2.8.
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [versioning](docs/VERSIONING.md): what 2.8
  changes from 2.6j, and how versions and build numbers are assigned.

## Build

The application uses Windows APIs. On macOS or Linux, build a Windows executable
with CMake 3.23 or later, Ninja, and the x86_64 MinGW-w64 toolchain on PATH.
On macOS these build dependencies can be installed with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja mingw-w64
```

From the project directory:

```sh
cmake --preset mingw-debug
cmake --build --preset mingw-debug
```

The executable is written to `dist/mingw-debug/bin/stars.exe`. CMake also compiles the
resources in `res/` and tracks their embedded files for rebuilds.

Wine is optional for building. If `wine` is on PATH when configuring, run with:

```sh
cmake --build --preset run-wine
```

For a release build:

```sh
cmake --preset mingw-release
cmake --build --preset mingw-release
```

This writes `dist/mingw-release/bin/stars.exe` with optimization enabled and
debug data stripped. Test hooks are disabled in ordinary builds.

## GitHub Actions

Every push to `main` builds the optimized MinGW Release executable and updates
the rolling [`latest` prerelease](https://github.com/sirgwain/stars/releases/tag/latest).
Both `stars.exe` and `stars!.hlp` are attached; download them into the same
directory. Superseded main builds remain available as workflow artifacts.

Pushing a version tag (for example `v2.8.0`) builds that tag's source, checks
that it reports exactly that version, and publishes a release with the same
two files. Other tags (such as `2.6jrc3`) publish releases named after the
tag. The rolling `latest` tag is excluded. See
[versioning](docs/VERSIONING.md) for how build numbers are derived:

```sh
git tag v2.8.0
git push origin v2.8.0
```

Pull requests build and run the complete tutorial and the unfinished-turn
rejection check under Wine/Xvfb. Diagnostic reports are retained even on failure.
The tutorial uses the same Release preset as the published builds, with the
read-only test observer enabled. The native regression workflow also builds in
Release mode on pull requests and main pushes, comparing
all checkpoints through turn 150 against the checked-in native baseline
(`tests/scaffold/fixtures/regression/native/`). The original game's
checkpoints are kept alongside it as the record of 2.6j behavior.
All workflows can also be run manually; the release workflow accepts `main`
or a tag. Publishing uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write`;
the tutorial uses read-only permissions.

## Regression save tooling

The standalone go module in `tests/savecli/` supplies the save
comparison and AI update commands used by checkpoint testing:

```sh
make regression        # every baseline scenario through turn 150
make regression-quick  # smallai4 through turn 10
make regression-export # after a full run, replace the baseline
```

`make regression` builds the fixed-seed release `stars.exe` and
`dist/stars-save`, runs a fresh `dist/scaffold/regression/native`, and
compares it with the checked-in baseline in
`tests/scaffold/fixtures/regression/native/`; any difference fails.
`SCENARIOS="noai smallai4"` and `THROUGH=10` limit a run. See
[the save CLI README](tests/savecli/README.md) and
[regression instructions](tests/scaffold/REGRESSION.md).
